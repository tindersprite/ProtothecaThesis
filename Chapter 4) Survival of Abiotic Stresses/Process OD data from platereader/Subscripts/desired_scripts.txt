Create plate reader maps # done

Pair maps and raw data # done

Map the raw data, save the mapped data # done

Normalise the mapped data, save normalised data

Identify which normalised data files are from the same experiment. Also identify which wavelengths have been used to measure OD

Combine normalised data of different wavelengths into the same file, save combined data

Compile all the combined data together
	check all the columns match
