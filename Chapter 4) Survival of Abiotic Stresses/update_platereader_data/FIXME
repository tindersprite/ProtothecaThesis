Need to have a systematic way to remove contaminated wells. I think I've just been editing the maping data, replacing the strain ID with "NA"

Need to stop generating QC and normalised plots of data that's already been processed

Need to have a way to reprocess data for which a plot has been deleted

Need to actually have compiled datasets and plots produced automatically from the compiled data

Should probably have some warning showing if a negative control looks like it's growing. Maybe make a linear model, and say if the gradient is over some number. Or just show a warning if the neg ever goes over 0.1
