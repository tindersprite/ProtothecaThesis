This repository contains a variety of scripts used in the thesis submitted to the University of Birmingham by Christopher David Shave for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

Scripts are provided for each chapter in which scripts were used to process or analyse data, and are present in folders indivating the chapter's name and number.

Raw data files are not inlcuded, but are available upon request.

Additionally, the hierarchical or project structures of these scripts has not been preserved

Some files that are common to multiple chapters will be available (but I've not decided where yet)
